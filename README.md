MemProcFS:
===============================
MemProcFS is an easy and convenient way of viewing physical memory as files in a virtual file system. 

Easy trivial point and click memory analysis without the need for complicated commandline arguments! Access memory content and artifacts via files in a mounted virtual file system or via a feature rich application library to include in your own projects!

Analyze memory dump files, <b>live memory</b> via DumpIt or WinPMEM, <b>live memory in read-write mode</b> from virtual machines or from [PCILeech](https://github.com/ufrisk/pcileech/) [FPGA](https://github.com/ufrisk/pcileech-fpga/) hardware devices!

It's even possible to connect to a remote LeechAgent memory acquisition agent over a secured connection - allowing for remote live memory incident response - even over higher latency low band-width connections! Peek into [Virtual Machines with MemProcFS](https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS/wiki/VM), [LiveCloudKd](https://github.com/ufrisk/LeechCore/wiki/Device_LiveCloudKd) or [VMware](https://github.com/ufrisk/LeechCore/wiki/Device_VMWare)!

Use your favorite tools to analyze memory - use your favorite hex editors, your python and powershell scripts, WinDbg or your favorite disassemblers and debuggers - all will work trivally with MemProcFS by just reading and writing files!

For additional documentation **please check out the [project wiki](https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS/wiki)** for in-depth detailed information about the file system itself, its API and its plugin modules! For additional information about memory acqusition methods check out the **[LeechCore project](https://github.com/ufrisk/LeechCore/)** or hop into the [#pcileech](https://discord.gg/sEkn3aa) Discord channel!

To get going clone the sources in the repository or download the [latest binaries, modules and configuration files](https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS/releases/latest) from the releases section and **check out the [guide](https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS/wiki).**



Installing:
===========
<b>Get the latest [binaries, modules and configuration files](https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS/releases/latest) from the latest release.</b> Alternatively clone the repository and build from source.

## Windows
Mounting the file system requires the <b>Dokany file system library</b> to be installed. Please download and install the latest version of Dokany version 2 at: https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/releases/latest

To capture live memory (without PCILeech FPGA hardware) download [DumpIt](https://www.comae.com/) and start MemProcFS via DumpIt /LIVEKD mode. Alternatively, get WinPMEM by downloading the most recent signed [WinPMEM driver](https://github.com/Velocidex/c-aff4/tree/master/tools/pmem/resources/winpmem) and place it alongside MemProcFS - detailed instructions in the [LeechCore Wiki](https://github.com/ufrisk/LeechCore/wiki/Device_WinPMEM).

PCILeech FPGA will require hardware as well as _FTD3XX.dll_ to be dropped alongside the MemProcFS binaries. Please check out the [LeechCore](https://github.com/ufrisk/LeechCore) project for instructions.

## Linux
MemProcFS is dependent on packages, please do a `sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0 fuse openssl lz4` before trying out MemProcFS. If building from source please check out the guide about [MemProcFS on Linux](https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS/wiki/_Linux).



Extensive Python, Java, C# and C/C++ API:
===============================
Include MemProcFS in your [C/C++](https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS/wiki/API_C), [C#](https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS/wiki/API_CSharp), [Java](https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS/wiki/API_Java) or [Python](https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS/wiki/API_Python) programming projects! Everything in MemProcFS is exposed via an easy-to-use API for use in your own projects! The Plugin friendly architecture allows users to easily extend MemProcFS with native C .DLL plugins or Python plugins!

Everything in MemProcFS is exposed as APIs. APIs exist for both C/C++ `vmmdll.h`, C# `vmmsharp.cs`, Java and Python `memprocfs.py`. The file system itself is made available virtually via the API without the need to mount it. SIt is possible to read both virtual process memory as well as physical memory! The example below shows reading 0x20 bytes from physical address 0x1000:
```
>>> import memprocfs
>>> vmm = memprocfs.Vmm(['-device', 'c:/temp/win10_memdump.raw'])
>>> print(vmm.hex( vmm.memory.read(0x1000, 0x20) ))
0000    e9 4d 06 00 01 00 00 00  01 00 00 00 3f 00 18 10   .M..........?...
0010    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................
```



Examples:
=========
Start MemProcFS from the command line - possibly by using one of the examples below.

Or register the memory dump file extension with MemProcFS.exe so that the file system is automatically mounted when double-clicking on a memory dump file!

- mount the memory dump file as default M: <br>`memprocfs.exe -device c:\temp\win10x64-dump.raw`
- mount the memory dump file as default M: with extra verbosity: <br>`memprocfs.exe -device c:\temp\win10x64-dump.raw -v`
- mount the memory dump file as default M: and start forensics mode: <br>`memprocfs.exe -device c:\temp\win10x64-dump.raw -forensic 1`
- mount the memory dump file as /home/pi/mnt/ on Linux: <br>`./memprocfs -mount /home/pi/linux -device /dumps/win10x64-dump.raw`
- mount the memory dump file as S: <br>`memprocfs.exe -mount s -device c:\temp\win10x64-dump.raw`
- mount live target memory, in verbose read-only mode, with DumpIt in /LIVEKD mode: <br>`DumpIt.exe /LIVEKD /A memprocfs.exe /C "-v"`
- mount live target memory, in read-only mode, with WinPMEM driver: <br>`memprocfs.exe -device pmem`
- mount live target memory, in read/write mode, with PCILeech FPGA memory acquisition device: <br>`memprocfs.exe -device fpga -memmap auto`
- mount a memory dump with a corresponding page files: <br>`memprocfs.exe -device unknown-x64-dump.raw -pagefile0 pagefile.sys -pagefile1 swapfile.sys`
