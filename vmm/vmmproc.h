* 1. VmmProcRefresh_MEM()    = refresh memory cache (except page tables).
* 2. VmmProcRefresh_TLB()    = refresh page table cache.
* 3. VmmProcRefresh_Fast()   = fast refresh incl. partial process refresh.
* 4. VmmProcRefresh_Medium() = medium refresh incl. full process refresh.
* 5. VmmProcRefresh_Slow()   = slow refresh.
* A slower more comprehensive refresh layer does not equal that the lower
* faster refresh layers are run automatically - user has to refresh them too.
